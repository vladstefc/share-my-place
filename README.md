This project was done during the 'JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2023 (Beginner + Advanced)' course made by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

1. git clone https://github.com/vladstefc/share-my-place.git;
2. cd share-my-place;
3. npm install (it might take a while);
4. install webpack-dev-server and also use Node LTS below version 17;
5. run npm run build:dev
6. copy the localhost link and paste it in your browser.

**You will need a Google API key in order for the website to work. Google API key is used in both index files and also in 'Utility/Location'.**
